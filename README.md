# 2. Technical 
## Documentation
## (Linux 40 task) üêß
1. File and Folder Create Command (TOUCH, MKDIR, VIM )
* Touch: used to create, change and modify the timestamps of a file.
  - **cat command**: It is used to create the file with content.
  - **Touch command**: It is used to create a file without any content. The file created using the touch command is empty. This command can be used when the user doesn‚Äôt have data to store at the time of file creation.
* mkdir: used used to make a new directory.
* vim: Vim is an advanced and highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It supports most file types and vim editor is also known as a programmer‚Äôs editor. We can use its plugin based on our needs.
  
2. File and Folder Permission (CHOWN, CHMOD, CHGRP)
* **chown**: used to change the file Owner or group. Whenever you want to change ownership, you can use chown command.
  - Syntax: chown owner_name file_name
* **chmod**
* [Reference](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/chown-command-in-linux-with-examples/)
4. Check File/Folder/Content (LS, LL, CAT, GREP, HEAD, TAIL, LESS, MORE, ECHO)
5. Copy and Move Command (RM, CP, MV, SCP, RSYNC)
  - **RM Command**: rm stands for remove here. rm command is used to remove objects such as files, directories, symbolic links and so on from the file system like UNIX.
  - Syntax: rm [OPTION]... FILE...
  - **CP Command**: cp stands for a copy. This command is used to copy files or groups of files or directories. It creates an exact image of a file on a disk with a different file name.
  - Syntax: cp [Source_file] [Destination_file]
  - **MV Command**: The mv command moves files and directories from one directory to another or renames a file or directory. If you move a file or directory to a new directory, it retains the base file name. When you move a file, all links to other files remain intact, except when you move it to a different file system. When you move a directory into an existing directory, the directory and its contents are added under the existing directory.
  - Syntax: mv [options(s)] [source_file_name(s)] [Destination_file_name]
6. User/Group and Access (USERADD, USERDEL, USERMOD, GROUPADD, GROUPDEL, SU, SUDO, SSH,)
